# 🚀 PRODIGY_CS_01

## 📝 Task Overview

**Task:** Implement Caesar Cipher  
**Description:** Develop a Python program capable of encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The program accepts user input for both the message and the shift value, enabling flexible encryption and decryption operations.  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 🌟 Beyond the Task: Additional Ciphers  

To further demonstrate cryptographic expertise, this project was expanded to include a variety of classical ciphers:  
- 🛡️ **Caesar Cipher**: A basic substitution cipher shifting characters by a fixed value.  
- ✏️ **Affine Cipher**: Applies linear transformation on characters for encryption.  
- 🔐 **Pig Pen Cipher**: A graphical substitution cipher using symbols.  
- 📡 **Morse Code**: Encodes text using dots and dashes for transmission.  
- 🌀 **Atbash Cipher**: A substitution cipher reversing the alphabet.  
- 📏 **Rail Fence Cipher**: A transposition cipher using zigzag patterns.  
- 🗺️ **Polybius Cipher**: A grid-based cipher converting characters into coordinates.  
- 🔍 **Bifid Cipher**: Combines substitution and transposition techniques.  
- 🔑 **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword.  
- 🧩 **Columnar Transposition Cipher**: Rearranges the plaintext into columns based on a key.  

These enhancements showcase a deep dive into cryptography, offering a robust exploration of encryption techniques.
