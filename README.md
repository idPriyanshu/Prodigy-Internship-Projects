# Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship Projects

This repository consolidates all five cybersecurity projects completed as part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship** (December 2024 – January 2025). These projects cover various foundational and advanced cybersecurity topics such as encryption, secure communications, keylogging, and network analysis. Each project is organized into its respective subdirectory.

---

## 🔐 Project 1: Caesar Cipher and Extended Ciphers

**Directory:** `PRODIGY_CS_01`

This project started with implementing the Caesar Cipher but was later extended to include multiple classical and modern encryption techniques:

* Caesar Cipher
* Affine Cipher
* Pig Pen Cipher
* Morse Code
* Base64 Encoding
* Atbash Cipher
* Rail Fence Cipher
* Polybius Cipher
* Bifid Cipher
* Vigenère Cipher
* Columnar Transposition

**Skills:** Python, Cryptography, Secure Encoding

## 🖼️ Project 2: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

**Directory:** `PRODIGY_CS_02`

This project involves encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques. The encryption is done by altering RGB values based on a key, and then restoring them during decryption.

**Skills:** Python, NumPy, PIL, Image Security

---

## 🔑 Project 3: Password Strength Checker

**Directory:** `PRODIGY_CS_03`

A tool to evaluate the strength of a password based on various parameters like length, complexity, entropy, and common patterns. It provides real-time feedback to users for creating strong passwords.

**Skills:** Python, Regex, Security Best Practices

---

## 🖥️ Project 4: Keylogger

**Directory:** `PRODIGY_CS_04`

A basic keylogger built for educational purposes that captures and logs keyboard strokes. It runs in the background and stores logs locally for analysis.

**Skills:** Python, pynput, Logging, Ethical Hacking Awareness

---

## 🌐 Project 5: Network Packet Analyzer (Packet Sniffer)

**Directory:** `PRODIGY_CS_05`

A real-time network packet analyzer that captures and displays network traffic data such as source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and payloads.

**Skills:** Python, Scapy, Socket Programming, Network Security
